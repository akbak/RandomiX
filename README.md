# RandomiX – The Absurd Machine

RandomiX is an absurd visual and auditory engine built on chaos. Every click generates a new shape, sound, direction, and color — without purpose, without score. The canvas becomes an unpredictable journal of randomness, a space where entropy paints. There's no goal. Just click, and let it evolve.

## Features

-   **Interactive Canvas**: Click anywhere to generate a new random element.
-   **Visual Chaos**: Creates random shapes (squares, circles, triangles, polygons) with random colors, sizes, rotations, and opacity.
-   **Auditory Feedback**: Each visual element is paired with a randomly generated sound using the Web Audio API.
-   **Save Your Creation**: Download the current state of the canvas as a PNG file.
-   **Minimalist UI**: A clean, retro-inspired interface built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

## How to Use

1.  Open the [live site](https://randomix-machine.windsurf.build).
2.  Click anywhere on the canvas to start generating.
3.  Use the "Clear Canvas" button to start over.
4.  Use the "Save as PNG" button to download your artwork.
